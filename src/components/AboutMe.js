          <p>
            Hi, I am Attyuttam Saha. I am currently working as an associate software developer in Goldman Sachs.

            I am an adaptable back end developer with a strong track record in creating efficient, scalable web applications. 
			I am proficient in Java and Spring Boot, with a deep understanding of RESTful APIs and microservices architecture.
			
			In my day to day work, I also work with tools like ReactJS, React-Redux, Redux-Saga for front end development and Cucumber, Junit etc for testing and am also proficient in working with relational databases like Oracle and Sybase.
			
            I am also experienced in the Agile methodology of software development.

            I take special interest in design principles and patterns to strengthen my core concepts of microservice development. 
            
            In my free time, I like to play the guitar, read books, binge anime and watch food vlogs ðŸ˜ƒ
